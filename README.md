The goal of Vibe is simple, bring users together through stunning photography. At Vibe we use Unsplash's powerful image API, JWT authentication, and MaterializeCss to empower the user to curate their own collection of personal collection of photography from some of the world's most talented photographers. These collection are meant for reference and inspiration. Not only can the user build their own collection, but they can view beautiful collections that other users have made as well.
